# SortingAlgorithms
Practicing with sorting


VERY ROUGHT at the moment. just a lot of "main" files that each have a sorting algorithm in them. I plan to seperate each into it's
own file soon, as well as put in a comparison on the number of swaps made that it can output as a useful comparison between each of
the different sorts.
